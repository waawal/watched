#Watched Repositories#

_Browse GitHub watchlists (with project descriptions)._

I sometimes use the watch-functionality to bookmark interesting projects. When I go to my watched-list in order to find back to a project I vaguely remember it's very often difficult to find the right project only by looking at the list ofnames. That's why this project exists.
