I often use the watch-functionality to bookmark interesting projects. When I go back to my watched-list in order to find back to a project I vaguely remember it's very often difficult to find the right project only by looking at the list of names. That's why this project exists.  
-- a *watchlist* with *descriptions*!

* The table is sorted with https://github.com/joequery/Stupid-Table-Plugin  
* JSON-objects formatted with https://github.com/janl/mustache.js  
* Routing handled by https://github.com/jgallen23/routie
* Spinning effect by https://github.com/fgnass/spin.js  
* Original theme by https://github.com/orderedlist
